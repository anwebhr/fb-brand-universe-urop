## FB Brand Universe Project

This is an HKUST Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program project to collate and display a dataset of brands collected from Facebook. The information of these brands, publicly available on their Facebook pages have been reduced to a 2 dimensional space with distance of each point from another representing how close they are in terms of category, industry or how competitive may one brand be with the other.

All the points, as of now plotted on a scatter plot form into clusters that can be analysed and zoomed into to understand their market standpoint better in terms of competitors. Each brand on the plot is searchable using the web interface.

The plot has been created using native D3.js, jQuery and Javascript along with Bootstrap for minor aesthetics.

The output of this project can be viewed at https://anwebhr.github.io/fb-brand-universe-urop/
